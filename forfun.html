      <h2>Who Am I? ðŸ¤”</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m Ben Stevenson, a storyteller, growth strategist, and digital adventurer. With a knack for marketing (and a 4.0 GPA to back it up), 
        Iâ€™ve worked with startups, built creative brands, and helped businesses thrive. Whether itâ€™s exploring business ideas, dissecting UFC fighter mindsets, 
        or growing my YouTube following to 15,000+ subscribers, Iâ€™m always finding new ways to challenge myself.
