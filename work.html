    <h1>Work with me</h1>
    <p>In progress </p>
    <p>Here are some things I want to work on eventually. If they interest you, reach out to me at bsteve731@gmail.com </p>
    <br>
    <p> - Podcast meetup for people who like listening to self improvement/business podcasts. We'd meet once a week, listen for an hour, then discuss</p>
    <p> - In most bibles, they have a section where it lists out issues you might be dealing with in life (e.g. self doubt, anger, lack of focus), and passages that would help you through those. I want to make something similar but with books, podcasts, and articles that might help.</p>
